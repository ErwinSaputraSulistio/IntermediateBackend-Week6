1.) Start.   
2.) First, take inputs from the user (real name, username, email, password).  
3.) After that, make some variables of user's input (realName, userName, userEmail, userPassword) with values from the body request of them (req.body).  
4.) Now, create a variable named "hashedUserPassword", that contains a value from variable "userPassword" then hashes it (in this case, I was using bCrypt to help me for the hashing process when an input came from the user).  
5.) Then, create a variable again named "newData" that'll be sent as a parameter to database query process, contains an object value with keys and values based by the user's first variables input in number 2 (realName, userName, userEmail, userPassword).  
6.) After that, create a function named "newUserData" with a paramater value passed from "newData", in this function we'll query the user's database and order it to insert the data into user's database.  
7.) Now, we make a statement for the result, if there's no error then give the result, else console an error message.  
8.) At last, execute the function newUserData(newData) and in no time the result will shown based on the statement in number 7 as JSON format.   
9.) End.
